This program sits in the system tray and monitors if kodi is running.
If it is, flaresolverr will be started without the console showing.
If kodi is shutdown, flaresolverr will also be shut down.
It polls for these processes once every 10 seconds.

If you want FlareKodi.exe to autostart with windows, create a shortcut to it
and place here:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

FlareKodi.exe must be copied to the same folder as flaresolverr.exe
